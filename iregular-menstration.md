##Irregular menstruation

Any abnormality in the menstrual cycle is collectively called irregular menstruation. Clinically, there are early menstruation, late menstruation, and irregular menstruation.

### [Cause and pathogenesis]

* Premature menstruation: multiple factors include
    * excessive yang in the body and an appetite for spicy food, which helps yang generate heat; or
    * depression of emotions, stagnation of the liver turning into fire, heat accumulating in the uterus, and blood-heat wandering; or
    * after a long illness, qi is damaged and yang is damaged, resulting in yin deficiency and deficiency heat, and losing solidity on Penetrating Vessel and Ren Mai.
    All these factors can lead to early menstruation.

* Delayed menstruation:
    * often caused by yang deficiency in the body and cold evil arising from within; or
    * during menstruation, being exposed to rain and water, gluttony in eating cold food, cold evil fighting in Penetrating Vessel and Ren Vessel, blood congealing with cold, and meridians being blocked; or
    * liver Qi not being soothed, Qi stagnation and blood stasis, poor blood circulation around the uterus; or
    * disorders after illness, excessive pregnancy, loss of nutrition and blood; or
    * fatigue from eating and drinking, deficiency of the spleen and stomach, insufficient sources of biochemistry, and lack of qi and blood, can cause late menstruation.

* Disturbed menstruation: often caused by liver stagnation and kidney deficiency. The liver stores blood and governs dispersion. If depression and anger damage the liver, excessive dispersion of liver qi will lead to early menstruation, and insufficient dispersion of liver qi will cause menstruation to be late. The kidneys are responsible for sealing and controlling fertility. If the body's kidney qi is insufficient, or there is excessive sexual intercourse or too much pregnancy, the kidneys will lose their sealing, Penetrating Vessel and Ren Mai are damaged, and the mechanism of blood overflow and accumulate is out of balance, resulting in irregular menstrual cycles.
